# Sorting Techniques
The repository includes a Graphical User Interface, depicting various Sorting Algorithms, created using PyQt5 in Python. <br>
=> The GUI has been designed using QtDesigner and implemented at the backend using Python3.7 .<br>
=> pyuic5 has been used to convert .ui files to .py files.<br>

**Important Points to Note**

1. The .py source codes and .ui files for the GUI are contained in the "GUI Folder".
2. The source codes and results used for generating graphs are included in the "Graphs" Folder.
3. Jupyter Notebook named "Comparitive Graphs" contains completely implemented python notebook for the graphs. The libraries used are matplotlib, seaborn, pandas. 
4. The screenshots showing the working of the GUI are included in "Screenshots" Folder.
5. The sorting algorithms : Count Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort are not optimized to work with negative entries.
6. While entering Custom Input for Bucket Sort, make sure that the input is uniformly distributed in a range and is of float data-type.
